# Store useful Python Scripts for Cyber here

These scripts have lived on my laptop for far too long now. It's time for them to live in a repo where I can easily access them even if I don't have my laptop

I call them Python Scripts for Cyber but they include any scripts I've made to make my life a bit easier whenever I've done something related to Cyber.
